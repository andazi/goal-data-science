    "\n",
    "### Categories of staatistics_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Descriptive\n",
    "    - Frequency : number of occurence of a data\n",
    "    - Central Tendency : Mean, Mode, Median\n",
    "    - Spread of the data : Range, Variance, Standard deviation\n",
    "    - Measure of position: Percentile, Quantile\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Inferential\n",
    "    - Interpreting the meaning of the descriptive statistics obtained by inferring thento the population\n",
    "    - Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data type\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Qualitative Data (Categorical)\n",
    "    - Examples: London, Water, Nigeria, Canada, Spirit, hazel\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Quantitative Data (Numerical)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Continuous\n",
    "        - Examples: 1.23, -1.32, 3.3333,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Discrete\n",
    "        - Example: 1,2,3,12,90000000000,\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level of Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Nominal\n",
    "    - Names and Labels\n",
    "    - Examples: Andazi, Paula, Tokyo, Orange\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Ordinal\n",
    "    - Ranks Categories in order\n",
    "    - Examples: Star Rating (0 - 5 stars), height (tall, very tall), \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Interval\n",
    "    - Has equal known interval\n",
    "    - Examples: 1991, 1993, 1995\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Ratio\n",
    "    - Has true or meaningful zero\n",
    "    - Examples: 1.2, 0.5\n",

    "--------\n",
    "### Moments of Business Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "    - Where a single value represent the entire Dataset\n",
    "        - Mean: This is the average of the Dataset( sum of dataset divided by number of dataset)\n",
    "        - Median: Middle value of a Dataset when sorted and if Middle value is two data, the mean of the two data is used as Median\n",
    "            - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 = Median = 4\n",
    "            - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 = Median = 4,5 = (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5\n",
    "        - Mode: Most repeated value in a dataset\n",
    "            - 1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4 = Mode = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "    -  This descripes the spread of the data from the center\n",
    "        - Variance: Average Squared Distance of all the data points from the mean\n",
    "        - Standard Deviation: Square Root of Variance\n",
    "        - Range: Differance between the Maximum and Minimum value of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Skewness\n",
    "    - Measure of Assymmetry in a Distributon Curve from a Normal Dsitribution\n",
    "        - Negatively Skewed\n",
    "            - Mode > Median > Mean on the x-axis\n",
    "        - Normal (no skew)\n",
    "            - Mode,Median, Mean are same value on the x -axis\n",
    "        - Positively Skew\n",
    "            - Mean > Median > Mode on the X axis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Kurtosis\n",
    "    - Central Peakness of fat-ness of the tails of the data\n",
    "        - Positive: Sharp Peaks and lighter tails\n",
    "        - Mesokurtic: Normal Distribution\n",
    "        - Negative: Wide peaks and thicker tails\n",
